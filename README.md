# BitcoinDisplayBeta
A webpage I created that enables user to view current Bitcoin price, updated every minute, in multiple different currencies.
Allows access of historical rates using calendar input. 
Google Chart that tracks and displays prices from last 30 days.
Animated background as a fun bonus.

What I learned:
  How to use JavaScript to fetch data from APIs and display them in HTML files.
  How to have user input from HTML trigger JavaScript functions.
  How to design a webpage with Bootstrap.
